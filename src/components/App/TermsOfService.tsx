              Binding Arbitration
            </h3>
            <p>
              If the Parties are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal
              negotiations, the Dispute (except those Disputes expressly
              excluded below) will be finally and exclusively resolved by
              binding arbitration. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT WITHOUT THIS PROVISION,
              YOU WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.
              The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the
              Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration
              Association (“AAA”) and, where appropriate, the AAA’s
              Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (“AAA
              Consumer Rules”), both of which are available at the AAA website
              www.adr.org. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator
              compensation shall be governed by the AAA Consumer Rules and,
              where appropriate, limited by the AAA Consumer Rules. If such
              costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive, we will
              pay all arbitration fees and expenses. The arbitration may be
              conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by
              phone, or online. The arbitrator will make a decision in writing,
              but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by
              either Party. The arbitrator must follow applicable law, and any
              award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so. Except
              where otherwise required by the applicable AAA rules or applicable
              law, the arbitration will take place in Hennepin, Minnesota.
              Except as otherwise provided herein, the Parties may litigate in
              court to compel arbitration, stay proceedings pending arbitration,
              or to confirm, modify, vacate, or enter judgment on the award
              entered by the arbitrator.
            </p>
            <p>
              If for any reason, a Dispute proceeds in court rather than
              arbitration, the Dispute shall be commenced or prosecuted in the
              state and federal courts located in Hennepin, Minnesota, and the
              Parties hereby consent to, and waive all defenses of lack of
              personal jurisdiction, and forum non conveniens with respect to
              venue and jurisdiction in such state and federal courts.
              Application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
              International Sale of Goods and the Uniform Computer Information
              Transaction Act (UCITA) are excluded from these Terms of Use.
            </p>
            <p>
              In no event shall any Dispute brought by either Party related in
              any way to the Site be commenced more than one (1) years after the
              cause of action arose. If this provision is found to be illegal or
              unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
              Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
              illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
              court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
              jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
              personal jurisdiction of that court.

              The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the
              Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
              permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any
              other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any
              Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize
              class action procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority
              for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative
              capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.

            <p>
              The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to
              the above provisions concerning binding arbitration: (a) any
              Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity
              of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any
              Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy,
              invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
              injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or
              unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to arbitrate any
              Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be
              illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a
              court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
              jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the
              personal jurisdiction of that court.
